# -Sign-Language-Translator-for-Speech-Impaired
The main objective is to translate sign language to text/speech. The framework provides a helping-hand for speech-impaired to communicate with the rest of the world using sign language. This leads to the elimination of the middle person who generally acts as a medium of translation. This would contain a user-friendly environment for the user by providing speech/text output for a sign gesture input.
